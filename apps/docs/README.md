# docs @ [docs.kaiden.sh](https://docs.kaiden.sh)

Serves as a personal knowledge hub where I’ll document and share notes, insights, and lessons learned throughout my journey as a software engineer. Whether it’s coding practices, debugging tips, tools worth exploring, or conceptual breakthroughs, this space will capture the essence of my growth and exploration.

Feel free to treat this as both a diary and a learning repository—an evolving snapshot of progress, challenges, and accomplishments in the realm of development.

#### Development

Run the following command at the root of the documentation (where docs.json lives)

```
mintlify dev
```

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `docs.json`
