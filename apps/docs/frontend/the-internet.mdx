## How does the internet work?

The Internet works through a global network of interconnected computers and servers, communicating via standardized protocols.
Data is broken into packets and routed through various network nodes using the Internet Protocol (IP).

These packets travel across different physical infrastructures, including fiber optic cables, satellites, and wireless networks.
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures reliable delivery and reassembly of packets at their destination.

Domain Name System (DNS) servers translate human-readable website names into IP addresses. When you access a website,
your device sends a request to the appropriate server, which responds with the requested data. This process, facilitated by
routers, switches, and other networking equipment, enables the seamless exchange of information across vast distances,
forming the backbone of our digital communications.

## What is HTTP?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It's an application-layer protocol
that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web browsers and servers.

HTTP operates on a request-response model: clients (usually web browsers) send requests to servers, which then respond with the requested
data. The protocol is stateless, meaning each request is independent of any previous requests.

HTTP supports various methods for different types of interactions with resources:
- **GET** - Retrieves data
- **POST** - Submits data to be processed/created
- **PUT** - Updates existing data
- **DELETE** - Removes data
- **PATCH** - Updates data partially

HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, using encryption to protect data in transit. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are more recent versions, offering improved
performance through features like multiplexing and header compression. Understanding HTTP is crucial for web development, as it underpins
how web applications communicate and function.

## Domain Name System (DNS)

### Domain Names

A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify and access websites on the internet. It serves as a more memorable alternative
to the numerical IP addresses that computers use to locate web servers.

Domain names consist of two main parts: the second-level domain (usually the website or organization name) and the top-level domain
(such as .com, .org, or .net). They are registered through domain registrars and must be unique within their top-level domain.

Domain names are crucial for branding, marketing, and establishing an online presence. The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain
names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites by typing in familiar names rather than complex number sequences.

Domain names can be customized, transferred, and renewed, playing a vital role in the structure and accessibility of the World Wide Web.

### DNS

DNS is a hierarchical, decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet
or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use
to identify each other.

DNS servers distributed worldwide work together to resolve these queries, forming a global directory service.

The system uses a tree-like structure with root servers at the top, followed by top-level domain servers (.com, .org, etc.), authoritative
name servers for specific domains, and local DNS servers.

DNS is crucial for the functioning of the Internet, enabling users to access websites and services using memorable names instead of numerical
IP addresses.

## Web Hosting

Web hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible on the internet. It involves storing
website files on powerful computers called servers, which are connected to a high-speed network.

When users enter a domain name in their browser, the web host serves the website's content. Hosting services range from shared hosting
(where multiple websites share server resources) to dedicated hosting (where a server is exclusively used by one client).

Other types include VPS hosting (Virtual Private Server), cloud hosting, and managed WordPress hosting. Web hosts typically provide additional
services such as email hosting, domain registration, SSL certificates, and technical support.

The choice of web hosting impacts a website's performance, security, and scalability, making it a crucial decision for any online presence.

## Web Browsers

A web browser is a software application that enables a user to access and display web pages or other online content through its graphical
user interface.
