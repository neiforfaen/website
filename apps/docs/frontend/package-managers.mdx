## Introduction

Package managers are tools that automate the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software packages
in a consistent manner. They handle dependency resolution, version management, and package distribution for programming
languages and operating systems.

Popular package managers include npm for JavaScript, pip for Python, and apt for Debian-based Linux distributions.

These tools maintain a centralized repository of packages, allowing developers to easily share and reuse code.
Package managers simplify project setup, ensure consistency across development environments, and help manage complex
dependency trees.

They play a crucial role in modern software development by streamlining workflow, enhancing collaboration, and improving
code reusability.

## Package Managers

### npm

npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js, providing a vast ecosystem of reusable JavaScript
code. It allows developers to easily share, discover, and install packages (libraries and tools) for their projects.

npm consists of a command-line interface for package installation and management, and an online repository of open-source
packages.

It handles dependency management, version control, and script running for Node.js projects. The npm registry is the
largest software registry in the world, containing over a million packages.

npm's package.json file defines project metadata and dependencies, enabling reproducible builds across different
environments.

Despite competition from alternatives like Yarn, npm remains the most widely used package manager in the JavaScript
ecosystem.

### pnpm

pnpm (performant npm) is a fast, disk-space efficient package manager for JavaScript and Node.js projects. It addresses
inefficiencies in npm and Yarn by using a unique approach to storing and linking dependencies.

pnpm creates a single, global store for all packages and uses hard links to reference them in project node_modules,
significantly reducing disk space usage and installation time.

It strictly adheres to package.json specifications, ensuring consistent installs across environments. pnpm offers
features like workspace support for monorepos, side-by-side versioning, and improved security through better isolation
of dependencies.

While less widely adopted than npm or Yarn, pnpm's performance benefits and efficient disk usage are attracting
increasing attention in the JavaScript community.

### Yarn

Yarn is a fast, reliable, and secure package manager for JavaScript, developed by Facebook as an alternative to npm
(Node Package Manager).

It addresses issues of consistency, security, and performance in dependency management. Yarn uses a lockfile to ensure
consistent installations across different environments and offers parallel installation of packages, significantly
speeding up the process.

It features offline mode, allowing installation from cached packages, and provides improved network performance through
request queuing and retries.

Yarn's focus on security includes checksum verification of every installed package. While it shares many features with
npm, Yarn's emphasis on speed, reliability, and security has made it a popular choice among developers, especially for
larger projects.

Recent versions of Yarn (Berry) introduce new features like Plug'n'Play for even faster and more efficient package
resolution.
