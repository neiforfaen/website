## Introduction

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is a core technology of the World Wide Web.

It allows for dynamic, client-side scripting in web browsers, enabling interactive web pages and user interfaces.
JavaScript supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

It's also used server-side through Node.js, for desktop application development with frameworks like Electron, and in
various other contexts.

The language features dynamic typing, first-class functions, and prototype-based object-orientation. JavaScript's
ubiquity in web development, coupled with its versatility and continuous evolution through ECMAScript standards, has
made it one of the most popular programming languages in use today.
