## Basics

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used on the frontend and gives the structure to the webpage which
you can style using CSS and make interactive using JavaScript.

HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages and web applications. It provides a structure for content
on the World Wide Web, using a system of elements and attributes to define the layout and content of a document.

HTML elements are represented by tags, which browsers interpret to render the visual and auditory elements of a web page.
The language has evolved through several versions, with HTML5 being the current standard introducing semantic elements,
improved multimedia support, and enhanced form controls.

HTML works in conjunction with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, forming the foundation of modern web
development.

## Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of web content, rather than merely defining its
appearance. It involves using HTML elements that clearly describe their purpose and content. Semantic HTML improves
accessibility, SEO, and code readability.

Key elements include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`. It also
encompasses using appropriate heading levels (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`,`<li>`), and data tables
(`<table>`, `<th>`, `<td>`).

Semantic HTML helps screen readers interpret page content, enables better browser rendering, and provides clearer
structure for developers.

By using semantically correct elements, developers create more meaningful, accessible, and
maintainable web documents that are easier for both humans and machines to understand and process.

## Forms and validation

Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out in the correct
format. This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in
the various form controls.

## Accessibility

Website accessibility is the practice of designing and developing websites that can be used by everyone, including people
with disabilities. It involves implementing features and standards that make web content perceivable, operable,
understandable, and robust for all users, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.

This includes providing text alternatives for images, ensuring keyboard navigation, using sufficient color contrast,
offering captions for audio content, and creating a consistent and predictable layout. Adhering to accessibility
guidelines not only improves usability for people with disabilities but also enhances the overall user experience for
all visitors while potentially increasing a site's reach and legal compliance.

## SEO Basics

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) basics involve strategies to improve a website's visibility and ranking in search engine
results. Key elements include creating relevant, high-quality content, proper use of keywords, optimizing meta tags and
URLs, ensuring mobile-friendliness, improving site speed, and building quality backlinks.

SEO also focuses on user experience, including easy navigation and responsive design. Technical aspects like XML sitemaps,
HTTPS security, and structured data markup play crucial roles. Understanding user intent, regularly updating content,
and adhering to search engine guidelines are essential practices.

Effective SEO combines on-page optimization, off-page tactics, and technical enhancements to increase organic traffic,
improve user engagement, and enhance online presence in an increasingly competitive digital landscape.
